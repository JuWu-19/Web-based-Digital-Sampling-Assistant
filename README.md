### üìò **Context**

The master thesis titled ***"Semantics-driven Digitalization Transformation Framework of Maintenance Strategies in the Pharmaceutical Industry"*** identifies challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry in adopting digital transformations. One of the key challenges includes the integration of complex networks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and effectively coordinating digital resources.

This reluctance to digitalize stems from a lack of reference models that can help in transitioning legacy work models and organizational structures. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry's maintenance activities are paramount to ensure equipment functionality and, ultimately, product quality.

Our solution? Develop a semantics-driven digitalization transformation framework focusing on the pharmaceutical industry's maintenance strategies. This framework aims to ensure the continuity and cohesion of digital resources and technologies, improving efficiency and adaptability.

### üåä **Digital Sampling Assistant's Role**

**Positioned proudly in the "Workflow Automation Module" within the "Service Layer" of our revolutionary digitalization transformation framework**, the Digital Sampling Assistant is a practical implementation of this strategy. Our case study focused on supporting water sampling activities in the Merck Serono facility at Vevey. This digital assistant, as part of an ecosystem comprising platforms and software providing web-based services, automates workflows for water sampling activities, exemplifying how our framework addresses the problem spaces and adapts to specific enterprise use-cases.

#### üñ•Ô∏è **User Experience**

As technicians dive into the platform:

1. A friendly message pops up, ensuring they pause briefly for connection with GLIMS and subsequent data synchronization.

#### üåü **Main Features**

1. **Electronic Worksheets**: Intuitively view and rank sampling tasks along with related stats using features like "Sampling Zone", "Sampling Method", and more. Filter tasks based on these very features for a tailored experience.
2. <table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG/menu_display_1.PNG" alt="Snapshot of Electronic Worksheets" width="55%"/></td>
    <td><img src="IMG/menu_display_2.PNG" alt="Filtering of Sampling Tasks" width="55%"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Snapshot of Electronic Worksheets</td>
    <td align="center">Filtering of Sampling Tasks</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<!--

2. **Interactive Digital Maps and Scene Pictures**: Navigate sampling zones marked with specific sampling points. Highlight, search, zoom in, and zoom out! Also, get a peek into the media related to a sample point with just a click.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="IMG/task_page_1.PNG" alt="Digital Maps and Sampling Points" width="100%"/></td>
    <td><img src="IMG/task_page_2.PNG" alt="Zooming Feature" width="100%"/></td>
    <td><img src="IMG/img_info_1.PNG" alt="Scene Images for Sampling Points" width="100%"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Digital Maps and Sampling Points</td>
    <td align="center">Zooming Feature</td>
    <td align="center">Scene Images for Sampling Points</td>
  </tr>

3. **Sampling Task Check-ins & On-Site Feedback**: Give real-time feedback and check off tasks as they're completed. Log vital details, all of which seamlessly transfer to the connected Sharepoint List.

4. **Real-time Progress Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance**: All up-to-the-minute details about sampling tasks are centralized. Plus, with Power BI's deep integration, expect advanced algorithms for predictive maintenance. It's a hub of information ready to support various modules in our digitalization transformation framework for water sampling activities!
